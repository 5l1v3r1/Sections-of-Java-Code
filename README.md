**About Code 66:**

Aoros came up with the idea to make a screenshare tool. We were going to work on it, me as developer and Aoros as manager. He promised me 50% of the money we earn. Now here's a list of stuff I didn't like:
- Aoros contacted people without telling me, promising them (a percentage of the) money
- Aoros wanted to call everything "LLC" because "it looks professional"
- Aoros botted follower on Twitter because "it looks professional"
- Aoros started a FAKE giveaway to gain more legit followers: http://prntscr.com/h90r88
- Their Vape Lite strings are confirmed to not work properly by Manthe, I can confirm this as well. They might work on some people but they false flag a lot.
- Aoros rushed the project and kept promising release dates without me being done with the tool

At this point I left. Aoros paid TheWGBbroz to work on the new tool. I joined back because I believe in second chances. Then more stuff happend:
- The mod scanner code was STOLEN from my old screenshare tool made for GoPvP. TheWGBbroz didn't know about this, Aoros just sent the source code to him without my permission.
- More than 50% of the strings were taken from the GoPvP screenshare tool
- Aoros lies about being under an NDA contract: https://imgur.com/a/gFfeJ
- I fixed bugs, added strings, added the x-ray resource pack scanner, obfuscated a couple times and in the end Aoros called me useless because I didn't do anything according to him
- Because I leaked their strings Aoros calls me a skid which is not true at all, he skidded MY code

In the end I made $0 from Code 66. Here are some more screenshots:

Don't believe what Aoros says about me. Just contact me on Discord and I'll tell you the thruth because I have nothing to hide: ImRowin#8123

**TheWGBbroz has nothing to do with this!**
